# web2py test scripts

**This First Script was a "clone" of the oficial ubuntu nginx web2py Script:**

[https://github.com/web2py/web2py/blob/master/scripts/setup-web2py-nginx-uwsgi-ubuntu.sh](https://github.com/web2py/web2py/blob/master/scripts/setup-web2py-nginx-uwsgi-ubuntu.sh)

**But set for Python3 envireonment.**

Also deserves credit this link, where I have grabbed the solution for Python3:

[https://www.tengiz.net/bootlepy-nginx-uwsgi-python3-with-virtualenv-on-debian/](https://www.tengiz.net/bootlepy-nginx-uwsgi-python3-with-virtualenv-on-debian/)

Please constribute and better the code!
